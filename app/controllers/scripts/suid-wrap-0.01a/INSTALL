First of all, my sincere apologies for not using autoconf. I'll start using
autoconf soon, but I just don't get around to playing with it.

Here is the quick installation guide:

1. Edit Makefile (see instructions in Makefile for more information).
   If you're not satisfied with the default paths, etc. you may also need
   to edit man/Makefile and src/Makefile.

2. Type make (in this directory). If you're lucky everything should should end
   up with a binary called suid-wrap.

3. Type make install. If you want to uninstall the files, just type
   make uninstall

That should be it for most people. If you have any trouble installing,
please feel free to ask me. If you just want to check out suid-wrap, before
actually installing anything, just type cd src && make. Run suid-wrap.

NOTE: If make complains that you don't have colorgcc, just search for
 colorgcc in src/Makefile and change it to gcc
