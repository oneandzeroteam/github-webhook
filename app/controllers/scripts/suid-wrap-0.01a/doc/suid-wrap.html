<h2><font face="Helvetica">What is suid-wrap?</font></h2>
<p>
suid-wrap is a suid wrapper for scripts. All you have to
do is to run suid-wrap with your script as parameter
</p>
<p>
For instance, if you were to execute a script called my-script
with two parameters, param1 and param2 respectively, you would
issue the following command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>
root@oasis:~# suid-wrap "my-script param1 param2"
</code>
</blockquote>

<h2><font face="Helvetica">I want it!</font></h2>
<p>
suid-wrap is hosted on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a>, so
the latest version can always be downloaded the usual way:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://download.sourgeforge.net/pub/sourceforge/isptools/">ftp site</a>
<li><a href="http://download.sourceforge.net/isptools/">web site</a>
</ul>
<p>
There is a source tarball and debian package for the i386 platform. If
enough people bug me about it I might release a binary tarball and/or Redhat
rpm package, but I'm not really in the mood for that (:
